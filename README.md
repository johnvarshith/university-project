# University Management System

This project was developed during a hackathon at **IIIT RK Valley**. It provides a comprehensive web-based system for managing various aspects of a university, including student portals, alumni networks, clubs, extracurricular activities, and campus services.

A unique feature of this project is the use of a **modern Bento grid layout**, giving the dashboard and pages a clean, modular, and visually appealing design inspired by contemporary UI trends.
